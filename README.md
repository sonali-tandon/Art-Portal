#ART LIBRARY COMMUNITY - Project to support and fund the UW Art Library



# Art-Portal
A Web Portal where art students can sell, buy, promote, and showcase their artwork. A larger portion of the sales goes to the Art Library while a commission is paid to the student as a motivation for their support to the library. There are two major sources of funding - selling of art student work and tickets of events.
