ART LIBRARY COMMUNITY - Project to support and fund the UW Art Library.

At the beginning of our project, we identified all stakeholders within the UW library
system including potential users of the library and the staff who work in front of or
behind the counter. Potential users include UW art students, UW faculty, local students,
research groups, local artists, and tourists. Management staff and other stakeholders
can be tech advisors, UW art library assistants, UW art library librarians, and private
funding groups.

After conducting our preliminary interviews with a fellow UW design student, the
Director of School of Art, and a student library assistant, we learned that the Art Library
is experiencing a shortage of funding and there has been less traffic inside the library
ever since the pandemic and funding insufficiency.

Design Solution :
# Art-Portal
A Web Portal where art students can sell, buy, promote, and showcase their artwork. A larger portion of the sales goes to the Art Library while a commission is paid to the student as a motivation for their support to the library. There are two major sources of funding - selling of art student work and tickets of events.

-The primary screens of the web portal are the login page, home page, about us page, dashboard and events page. 

-This is the final iteration of our web portal after integrating all the feedback we received from our usability testing.
